## Streamlit Framework

Streamlit is described as a framework for deploying visualizations and dashboards as apps, it is primarily geared towards use-cases of data science and machine learning. However, it is much more than a simple Python library; itâ€™s an entire ecosystem which incorporates other libraries and offers a plethora of features. Hence, the creators are accurate in calling it a framework.
For a while I was looking for a way to deploy some analysis or a dashboard via an app that could easily be viewed by anyone on a browser. Streamlit provided the perfect solution for that!
